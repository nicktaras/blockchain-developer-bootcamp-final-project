Blockden

An ERC1155 Dapp where users will mint a set of blocks of different colours, but also invisible ones to create a collaborative masterpeice.

- **Mint**: a selection of blocks with one transaction (series 1 of blockade tokens)
- **Build**: Then can next select where their tokens will go on an x,y,z co-ordinate system (off chain part)
- **Transaction**: the user can apply the following transaction to apply the blocks (where the their transaction will contain an last transaction increment value to help prevent front running / other methods will be reviewed to help ensure this application can be enjoyed by users, over bots)
- **Dapp**: 3D Dapp to show the data and allow users to navigate the creations of each other
- (Idea): Interoperability between other contracts that wish to add blocks to the Dapp. Where the smart contract can accept a mapping of other smart contracts, where the Dapp will search all to apply the views - like different dimensions...

Totem Forrest - A social justice token to support what you believe in. In traditional context, a totem is your spirit animal and also an entity that you should protect from harm during your lifetime. The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy

1 Users can buy existing Sprits or Create their own (following template guidelines)

2 NFTs created must fall into a spirit animal/creature (if any are non-family friendly people can vote for them to be moved from the collection to a sub collection of banned NFTs)

3 A fraction of the tokens when bought and sold will be banked for supporting that animal in the real world 

4 When a spirit has raised X amount of funds a vote can be made to decide where the funds should go (which cause) by the owners

5 People can add new causes to the platform, which can be voted towards on chain

5 The NFT's will reside in an actual game where they can be found living. Users will be able control a first person view to navigate the world.

6 stats will be kept of how much money has been raised / on chain

7 the NFT's will be designed in such a way that they can feature on OpenSea but contain logic to animate/function in the game

8 ERC1155 will be considered as the token type to enable multi-purchase/multi-sales to reduce the costs for users

NFT Arcade & Market Place

1 Users enter a fun fair of collaborative games

2 You must by an NFT to play (minted with specific properties embedded)

3 The outcome is saved on the blockchain by the winner (deducted from their winnings)

3 it costs X Polygon to play each game. 

4 Upon winning a prize the winner can redeem the NFT in Eth or with Polygon

3. Contain smart contract(s) which:
--Are commented to the specs described by NatSpec Solidity documentation
--Use at least two design patterns from the "Smart Contracts" section

8. Hosted on Github Pages, Heroku, Netlify, Fleek, or some other free frontend service that gives users a public interface to your decentralized application? (That address should be in your README.md document) YES/NO

9. Have clear instructions for:
