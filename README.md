Blockden

An ERC1155 Dapp where users will mint a set of blocks of different colours, but also invisible ones to create a collaborative masterpeice.

- **Mint**: a selection of blocks with one transaction (series 1 of blockade tokens)
- **Build**: Then can next select where their tokens will go on an x,y,z co-ordinate system (off chain part)
- **Transaction**: the user can apply the following transaction to apply the blocks (where the their transaction will contain an last transaction increment value to help prevent front running / other methods will be reviewed to help ensure this application can be enjoyed by users, over bots)
- **Dapp**: 3D Dapp to show the data and allow users to navigate the creations of each other
- (Idea): Interoperability between other contracts that wish to add blocks to the Dapp. Where the smart contract can accept a mapping of other smart contracts, where the Dapp will search all to apply the views - like different dimensions...

4 When a spirit has raised X amount of funds a vote can be made to decide where the funds should go (which cause) by the owners

5 People can add new causes to the platform, which can be voted towards on chain

5 The NFT's will reside in an actual game where they can be found living. Users will be able control a first person view to navigate the world.

6 stats will be kept of how much money has been raised / on chain

7 the NFT's will be designed in such a way that they can feature on OpenSea but contain logic to animate/function in the game
